     <li><b>Early attempts</b></li>
       <p>The mountain was first surveyed by a European survey team in 1856. Team member Thomas Montgomerie designated the mountain "K2" for being the second 
          peak of the Karakoram range. The other peaks were originally named K1, K3, K4, and K5, but were eventually renamed Masherbrum, Gasherbrum IV, Gasherbrum II,
          and Gasherbrum I, respectively. In 1892, Martin Conway led a British expedition that reached "Concordia" on the Baltoro Glacier.</p>
      <li><b>Success and repeats</b></li>
        <p>The 1954 Italian Karakoram expedition finally succeeded in ascending to the summit of K2 via the Abruzzi Spur on 31 July 1954.
           On 9 August 1977, 23 years after the Italian expedition, Ichiro Yoshizawa led the second successful ascent, with Ashraf Aman as the first native Pakistani 
           climber. The Japanese expedition took the Abruzzi Spur, and used more than 1,500 porters.
           In 1986, two Polish expeditions summitted via two new routes, the Magic Line[49] and the Polish Line (Jerzy Kukuczka and Tadeusz Piotrowski). 
           Piotrowski fell to his death as the two were descending. This latter route has never been repeated.
          Thirteen climbers from several expeditions died in the 1986 K2 Disaster. Another six mountaineers died on 13 August 1995, while eleven climbers died
          in the 2008 K2 disaster.</p>
     <li><b>Recent attempts</b></li>
        <p>2010<br />
            On 6 August 2010, Fredrik Ericsson, who intended to ski from the summit, joined Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner on the way to the summit of K2. Ericsson fell
            1,000 metres (3,300 ft) and was killed. Kaltenbrunner aborted her summit attempt.Despite several attempts, nobody reached the summit.<br />

           <b>2011</b><br />
              On 23 August 2011, a team of four climbers reached the summit of K2 from the North side. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner became the first woman to complete 
              all 14 eight-thousanders without supplemental oxygen. Kazakhs Maxut Zhumayev and Vassiliy Pivtsov completed their eight-thousanders quest. 
              The fourth team member was Dariusz Załuski from Poland.<br />
           <b>2012</b><br />
             The year started with a Russian team aiming for a first winter ascent. The expedition ended with the death of Vitaly Gorelik due to frostbite and 
             pneumonia. The Russian team cancelled the ascent. In the summer season, K2 saw a record crowd standing on its summit—28 climbers in a single 
             day—bringing the total for the year to 30.<br />
           <b>2013</b><br />
             On 28 July 2013, two New Zealanders, Marty Schmidt and his son Denali, died after an avalanche destroyed their camp. A guide had reached their camp,
             but said they were nowhere to be seen and the campsite tent showed signs of having been hit by an avalanche. British climber Adrian Hayes, who was with
             the group, later posted on his Facebook page that the campsite had been wiped out.<br />
           <b>2014</b><br />
             On 26 July 2014, the first team of Pakistani climbers scaled K2. There were six Pakistani and three Italian climbers in the expedition, called K2 60 Years
             Later, according to BBC. Previously, K2 had only been summitted by individual Pakistanis as part of international expeditions. Another team, consisting 
             of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa Akita, Maya Sherpa, and Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, became the first Nepali women to climb K2.<br />
             On 27 July 2014, Garrett Madison leda team of three American climbers and six Sherpas to summit K2.<br />
           <b>2017</b><br />
              On 28 July 2017, Vanessa O'Brien led an international team of 12 with Mingma Gyalje Sherpa of Dreamers Destination to the summit of K2 and became the
              first British and American woman to summit K2, and the eldest woman to summit K2 at the age of 52 years old. She paid tribute to Julie Tullis and 
              Alison Hargreaves, two British women who summited K2, in 1986 and 1995 respectively, but died during their descents. Other notable summits included John
              Snorri Sigurjónsson and Dawa Gyalje Sherpa who joined his sister (Dawa Yangzum Sherpa), becoming the second set of siblings to summit K2.Both Mingma 
              Gyalje Sherpa and Fazal Ali recorded their second K2 summits.<br />
          <b>2018</b><br />
              On 22 July 2018, Garrett Madison became the first American climber to reach the summit of K2 more than once when he led an international team of eight
              climbers, nine Nepali Sherpas, four Pakistani high altitude porters, and two other Madison Mountaineering guides to the summit.<br />
              On 22 July 2018, Polish mountaineer and mountain runner Andrzej Bargiel became the first person to ski down from summit to base camp.<br />
          <b>2019</b><br />
              On 25 July 2019, Anja Blacha became the first German woman to summit K2. She climbed without the use of supplemental 
              oxygen.<a href="Website.html#top">Top</a></font></ul></p>
