  <p> K2, at 8,611 metres above sea level, is the second highest mountain in the world, after Mount Everest at 8,848 metres.It is located on the China–Pakistan border 
      between Baltistan in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of northern Pakistan,and Dafdar Township in Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang, China.</p>

 <h1><a name="a">Name </a><h1>
   <p><font size="4">
    The name K2 is derived from the notation used by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of British India.  Thomas Montgomerie made the first survey of the Karakoram from 
   <a href="linkmethod6.html"> Mount Haramukh</a>, some 210 km (130 mi) to the south,  and sketched the two most prominent peaks, labeling them K1 and K2.  The policy of the Great Trigonometrical
    Survey was to use local names for mountains wherever possible and K1 was found to be known locally as Masherbrum. K2, however, appeared not to have acquired a local name, possibly due to its remoteness.<a href="#top">Top</a></font></p>

    
   
  <h1><a name="b"> Geographical setting</a><h1>
   <p><font size="4">
    K2 lies in the northwestern Karakoram Range. It is located in the Baltistan region of Gilgit–Baltistan, Pakistan, and the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous Countyof Xinjiang, 
    China.The Tarim sedimentary basin borders the range on the north and the Lesser Himalayas on the south. Melt waters from vast glaciers,such as those south and east 
    of K2,feed agriculture in the valleys and contribute significantly to the regional fresh-water supply.</font></p>
  
  <p><font size="4">
    K2 is ranked 22nd by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain's independent stature, because it is part of the same extended area of uplift 
   (including the Karakoram, the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalaya) as Mount Everest, in that it is possible to follow a path from K2 to Everest that goes no lower
    than 4,594 metres (15,072 ft), at the Kora La on the Nepal/China border in the Mustang Lo. Many other peaks that are far lower than K2 are more independent in 
    this sense. It is, however, the most prominent peak within the Karakoram range.<a href="#top">Top</a></font></p>
    
   <h1><a name="c">Climbing routes and difficulties </a><h1>
     <p><font size="4">
     There are a number of routes on K2, of somewhat different character, but they all share some key difficulties, the first being the extremely high altitude and
     resulting lack of oxygen: there is only one-third as much oxygen available to a climber on the summit of K2 as there is at sea level. The second is the
     propensity of the mountain to experience extreme storms of several days duration, which have resulted in many of the deaths on the peak. The third is the steep, 
     exposed, and committing nature of all routes on the mountain, which makes retreat more difficult, especially during a storm. Despite many attempts there have been
     no successful winter ascents. All major climbing routes lie on the Pakistani side, which is also where base camp is located.</font></p>
